# Elector Journey: Elector Applications

## Adding a new elector

For example, from a phone call.

1. Do a *Property Search* first.
    * Check property and people already registered or in chasing cycle.
1. In person list for property, `right click` > `Add Elector`.
    * Opens the *New Elector Wizard*.  Do not go directly to this wizard as you cannot see the names of people currently registered at that address.
1. Enter a previous address.
    * If address is in same Local Authority area, wizard will ask whether to remove old record.
    * If in other Local Authority area, wizard will send message to old Local Authority.
1. Enter details.
    * If not all required data given (NINO & DoB), the *Potential Elector* workflow will be entered and an ITR sent.  Do not bother asking for other details as these will be entered via the ITR.
    * If all required details given, the *Elector Determination* workflow will be used.

* There is a *Fast Add Elector*, to quickly add multiple records.  You cannot, however, see which ones you have just entered.
